## 💡 Reflection
This was my first game development project and my introduction to **C#** and **Unity**.  
I learned:
- How to debug complex animations and transitions
- Designing gameplay mechanics with OOP
- The value of persistence and problem-solving under challenges

This project sparked my interest in game development and gave me practical coding experience beyond coursework.
